# 🚨 URGENT: Railway Bot Token Fix

## ❌ **Current Issue:**
```
BOT_TOKEN not found in environment variables
BOT_TOKEN not found in environment variables
BOT_TOKEN not found in environment variables
```

Your bot is **deployed but crashing** because Railway doesn't have the bot token.

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX (5 steps):**

### **Step 1: Open Railway**
Go to: **https://railway.app**

### **Step 2: Login & Find Project**
- Login with GitHub
- Look for: **"setupia-ai-saver"** project
- Click on it

### **Step 3: Go to Variables**
- Click **"Variables"** tab (in the sidebar)
- Look for **"+ New Variable"** button

### **Step 4: Add BOT_TOKEN**
Click **"+ New Variable"** and enter:
```
Name: BOT_TOKEN
Value: 7963774785:AAHBSOEAoxVTPXUCo47kZmvdh--xySjtN0I
```

### **Step 5: Save**
- Click **"Add"**
- Railway will automatically redeploy

## ⏱️ **Wait 2 Minutes**
- Railway needs time to redeploy with new variable
- Check logs for success message

## ✅ **Success Looks Like:**
```
🚀 Starting Setupia AI Saver bot...
   Bot: @SetupiaSaverBot  
   Ready to receive URLs!
```

## 📱 **Test from Phone:**
1. Open Telegram
2. Search: `@SetupiaSaverBot`
3. Send: `/start`
4. Should get welcome message!

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working:**
- Double-check variable name is exactly: `BOT_TOKEN`
- Verify token value has no extra spaces
- Wait 3-5 minutes for full redeploy
- Check Railway deployment logs

**This one environment variable fix will make your bot work 24/7!** 🚀
