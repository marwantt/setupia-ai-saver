# 🔑 Where to Add BOT_TOKEN

## ❌ **NOT on Git/GitHub**

**Why NOT Git?**
- Git stores **code**, not **secrets**
- Bot tokens should **NEVER** be in code repositories
- `.env` files are **intentionally excluded** from Git
- Anyone can see GitHub repositories

**Example of what NOT to do:**
```bash
# ❌ NEVER do this:
git add .env
git commit -m "added bot token"  # This exposes your token!
```

## ✅ **YES on Railway Dashboard**

**Why Railway?**
- Railway **runs your bot** in the cloud
- Environment variables are **secure** in Railway
- Only you can see the variables
- Railway needs the token to start your bot

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Railway Setup:**

### **1. Open Railway**
- Go to: **https://railway.app**
- Login with your GitHub account

### **2. Find Your Project**
- Look for: **"setupia-ai-saver"**
- Click on the project

### **3. Go to Variables**
- Click **"Variables"** tab (in the left sidebar)
- This is where environment variables go

### **4. Add BOT_TOKEN**
- Click **"+ New Variable"**
- Enter:
  - **Name**: `BOT_TOKEN`
  - **Value**: `7963774785:AAHBSOEAoxVTPXUCo47kZmvdh--xySjtN0I`
- Click **"Add"**

### **5. Auto-Deploy**
- Railway automatically redeploys your bot
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

## 🔄 **The Flow:**

```
Your Computer (Local)     →    GitHub (Code Storage)    →    Railway (Running Bot)
├── bot.py                     ├── bot.py                     ├── bot.py (running)
├── .env (BOT_TOKEN)          ├── requirements.txt           ├── BOT_TOKEN (from Variables)
└── requirements.txt          └── Dockerfile                 └── Environment Variables
     ↑                                                             ↑
   Stays Local                                              Added in Dashboard
   (Security)                                               (Secure Runtime)
```

## 💡 **Think of it Like This:**

- **Git/GitHub** = Your **code library** (public)
- **Railway** = Your **computer in the cloud** (private)
- **Environment Variables** = **Settings for the running bot**

## ✅ **After Adding to Railway:**

**Before:**
```
❌ BOT_TOKEN not found in environment variables
```

**After:**
```
✅ 🚀 Starting Setupia AI Saver bot...
✅ Bot: @SetupiaSaverBot
✅ Ready to receive URLs!
```

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Keep `.env` files local
- Use Railway environment variables
- Never commit tokens to Git

❌ **DON'T:**
- Put tokens in code
- Commit `.env` files
- Share tokens publicly

**Remember: Railway is where your bot runs, so that's where it needs its environment variables!** 🚀
